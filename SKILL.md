# agent-trust

You have access to a community trust network for x402 payment endpoints. Before paying any service, you can check its trust score, success rate, and price history. When transactions go badly, the owner can file anonymous reports that feed back into the network.

## Available Tools

### check-endpoint.sh

Look up trust data for an endpoint URL. Use this before any x402 payment to assess risk.

```bash
# Basic trust check
check-endpoint.sh https://api.stockdata.xyz/report/AAPL

# Check with price anomaly detection
check-endpoint.sh https://api.stockdata.xyz/report/AAPL --price 0.05
```

Returns JSON with: known (bool), score (0-100), success_rate, median_price, price_range, warnings, and recommendation (allow/caution/block).

### report.sh

Queue an anonymous report about an endpoint. Use only when the owner explicitly requests it.

```bash
# Report a post-payment failure (paid but got bad data)
report.sh https://shady-data.xyz/api/v2 post_payment_failure 0.50

# Report a pre-payment failure (failed before payment completed)
report.sh https://broken.example.com/api pre_payment_failure 0.10

# Report a successful transaction (when auto-positive is off)
report.sh https://api.stockdata.xyz/report/AAPL success 0.03
```

### sync-trust-db.sh

Download the latest trust database from CDN. Normally runs nightly.

```bash
sync-trust-db.sh           # Download if older than 24h
sync-trust-db.sh --force   # Force re-download
```

### status.sh

Show trust database status and sync information.

```bash
status.sh          # DB age, endpoint count, file size
status.sh --full   # Also show pending reports and config
```

### dashboard.sh

Manage the local web dashboard for trust data exploration.

```bash
dashboard.sh start    # Start dashboard (http://127.0.0.1:18921)
dashboard.sh stop     # Stop dashboard
dashboard.sh status   # Check if running
dashboard.sh url      # Print dashboard URL
```

## Pre-Transaction Verification

When agent-budget detects a payment is about to happen, check the endpoint first:

1. Run `check-endpoint.sh <url>` to get the trust assessment
2. If recommendation is `allow` (score 70+): proceed normally
3. If recommendation is `caution` (score 40-69 or unknown): warn the user, proceed if they confirm
4. If recommendation is `block` (score <40): warn the user strongly, do not proceed without explicit confirmation

## When to Use

- **Before any x402 payment** → `check-endpoint.sh <url>` to check trust score
- **Price seems high** → `check-endpoint.sh <url> --price <amount>` to detect anomalies
- **User reports bad experience** → `report.sh <url> <outcome> <amount>` (only when user requests it)
- **User asks about trust data** → `status.sh` for DB status, or `dashboard.sh start` for visual exploration
- **Trust data seems stale** → `sync-trust-db.sh` to refresh

## Important

- **Never auto-report negative signals.** Only queue negative reports when the owner explicitly clicks "Report" or asks you to.
- **Positive signals can be automatic** if the owner has enabled `auto_positive_signals` in settings.
- **Recommendations are advisory.** The owner's configured policy in agent-budget determines the final action.
- **Unknown endpoints get `caution`**, not `block`. Absence of data is not evidence of bad behavior.
